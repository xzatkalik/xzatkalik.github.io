		<h3>Apache Libcloud</h3>
		<p>
			What it’s for: To access multiple cloud providers through a single, steady, and unified API.
			Why it’s great: With support for both the 2.x and 3.x flavor of Python, APIs are available for DNS, compute, storage, and load balancing. PyPy is supported as well for those using the PyPy version of Python for the additional performance. Apache Libcloud has a unified mechanism for dealing with dozens of providers and the related methods for manipulating their resources is a boon for cloud providers
		</p>

		<h3>Numpy</h3>
		<p>
			Matematicka kniznica adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
		</p>

		<h3>Pillow</h3>
		<p>
			Image processing = spracovanie obrazu
			Why it’s great: Pillow aims to be both easier to use than PIL (Python Imaging Library) and code-compatible with PIL via minimal changes. Extensions are included for talking to both native Windows imaging functions and Python’s Tcl/Tk-backed Tkinter GUI package. Pillow is available through GitHub or the PyPI repository.
		</p>

		<h3>Pygame</h3>
		<p>
		What it’s for: A cross-platform set of Python modules for creating video games.

		Why it’s great: Pygame includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language. It provides a useful way to function with many GUI-oriented behaviours that might otherwise need a lot of heavy lifting: dealing with multichannel sound; drawing canvas and sprite graphics; handling windows and click events; collision detections; and so on. Not every app, and not even every GUI app, will benefit from being built with Pygame, but take a closer look at what it provides and you might be surprised.		
		</p>

		<h3>Scrapy</h3>
		<p>
	What it’s for: Screen scraping and Web crawling.

Why it’s great: Scrapy can be used to extract data using APIs or as a general purpose web crawler. It not only keeps the entire process of scraping simple but also creates a class that describes the type of item(s) you want scraped and write some rules about how to remove that data from the page. The results are exported as JSON, XML, CSV, or any number of other formats. The gathered data can be saved raw, or it can be cleaned as it’s imported. Additionally, Scrapy can be extended to allow many other behaviors, such as handling session cookies or how to handle logging into a website. Images, too, can be automatically tapped by Scrapy and be related with the scraped matter.
