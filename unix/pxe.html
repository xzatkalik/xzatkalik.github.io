<h2>TFTP Setup</h2>
<pre>


    TFTP is a very simple file-transfer protocol, which is very similar to FTP but which doesn't use any kind of authentication. If you're not already running a TFTP server you can install one by running:

    root@itchy:~# apt-get install tftpd-hpa

    Once installed you'll need to enable it by editing the file /etc/default/tftpd-hpa. You should change RUN_DAEMON to yes, leaving you with contents like these:

    #Defaults for tftpd-hpa
    RUN_DAEMON="yes"
    OPTIONS="-l -s /var/lib/tftpboot"

    Now create the root directory, if it is missing, and start the server:

    root@itchy:~# mkdir -p /var/lib/tftpboot
    root@itchy:~# /etc/init.d/tftpd-hpa start
    Starting HPA's tftpd: in.tftpd.

    Once our systems have retrieved an IP address via DHCP they will request files from beneath the /var/lib/tftpboot root directory. We'll come back to the contents of this directory shortly.
