NUX - wget full website - full site download
BEST WAY TO DOWNLOAD FULL WEBSITE WITH WGET
I show two ways, the first way is just one command that doesnt run in the background - the second one runs in the background and in a different "shell" so you can get out of your ssh session and it will continue either way
First make a folder to download the websites to and begin your downloading: (note if downloading www.kossboss.com, you will get a folder like this: /websitedl/www.kossboss.com/ )

(STEP1)

mkdir /websitedl/
cd /websitedl/

(STEP2)

1st way:
    wget --limit-rate=200k --no-clobber --convert-links --random-wait -r -p -E -e robots=off -U mozilla http://www.kossboss.com

2nd way:
IN THE  BACKGROUND DO WITH NOHUP IN FRONT AND & IN BACK
    nohup wget --limit-rate=200k --no-clobber --convert-links --random-wait -r -p -E -e robots=off -U mozilla http://www.kossboss.com &

THEN TO VIEW OUTPUT ( it will put a nohup.out file where you ran the command):

    tail -f nohup.out
WHAT DO ALL THE SWITCHES MEAN:
--limit-rate=200k: Limit download to 200 Kb /sec
--no-clobber: don't overwrite any existing files (used in case the download is interrupted and
resumed).
--convert-links: convert links so that they work locally, off-line, instead of pointing to a website online
--random-wait: Random waits between download - websites dont like their websites downloaded
-r: Recursive - downloads full website
-p: downloads everything even pictures (same as --page-requsites, downloads the images, css stuff and so on)
-E: gets the right extension of the file, without most html and other files have no extension
-e robots=off: act like we are not a robot - not like a crawler - websites dont like robots/crawlers unless they are google/or other famous search engine
-U mozilla: pretends to be just like a browser Mozilla is looking at a page instead of a crawler like wget

(DIDNT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING AND WHY)
-o=/websitedl/wget1.txt: log everything to wget_log.txt - didnt do this because it gave me no output on the screen and I dont like that id rather use nohup and & and tail -f the output from nohup.out
-b: because it runs it in background and cant see progress I like "nohup <commands> &" better
--domain=kossboss.com: didnt include because this is hosted by google so it might need to step into googles domains
--restrict-file-names=windows:  modify filenames so that they will work in Windows as well. Seems to work good without it
